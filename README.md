# Seam-Carving
- Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of width (or height) at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row.
- Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image. Although the underlying algorithm is simple and elegant, it was not discovered until 2007. Now, it is now a core feature in Adobe Photoshop and other computer graphics applications.
